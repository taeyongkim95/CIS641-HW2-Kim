# Taeyong Kim - Portfolio Page

* I look up reviews and information about mechanical keyboards and hi-fi headphones way too often
* My Steam backlog is way too big for my liking
* You can't go wrong with a nice cold glass of water - check out r/hydrohomies

## Technical Background
I got my Bachelor's with Digital Communications at Calvin College where I didn't do too much programming but got the basic foundations set. Then I worked as a Web Developer (mainly Wordpress custom themes) at a Marketing firm right after graduation for about two years. I am currently working as a Configuration Services Developer at OST and am on my second year.

## CIS 641 Project Overview
[github.io page](https://taeyongkim95.github.io/GVSU-CIS641-TEAMKIM/)

My project for this semester will be a Car Configurator built in the Unity Engine. The user will be able to configure various features of a car like the paint color of its outer body and seat material. User experience will be key so the performance and graphical fidelity of the Configurator will be important. After the user is finished with configuring the car, an option to go around on a test drive will be available the user will be able to control the car using basic controls (WASD) around a very simple circuit. The user can also see the total price of the configured car and go through a false "Purchasing" process that ultimately leads to nowhere.
