* I look up reviews and information about mechanical keyboards and hi-fi headphones way too often
* My Steam backlog is way too big for my liking
* You can't go wrong with a nice cold glass of water - check out r/hydrohomies

## Technical Background
I got my Bachelor's with Digital Communications at Calvin College where I didn't do too much programming but got the basic foundations set. Then I worked as a Web Developer (mainly Wordpress custom themes) at a Marketing firm right after graduation for about two years. I am currently working as a Configuration Services Developer at OST and am on my second year.
